# FixWin81Taskbar

Removes the start menu on the Windows 8.1+ extended taskbar, as well as returns the functionality of bringing the primary taskbar into the foreground when the extended taskbar is clicked.

# Usage

I'll only supply x64 builds of this application, if you run 32bit Windows, you'll need to build the application yourself.

Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/vevix/FixWin81Taskbar/releases). The application will add itself to startup so you only need to run it once.
