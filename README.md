# Usage

I'll only supply x64 builds of this application, if you are running 32bit Windows you'll have to build the application yourself.

Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/vevix/FixWin10Taskbar/releases) and store it somewhere. The application will add itself to startup so you only need to run it once.
