# FixWin81Taskbar

Removes the start menu on the extended taskbar, as well as returns the functionality of setting the primary taskbar to the foreground when the extended taskbar is clicked.

# Usage

I'll only supply x64 builds of this application, if you are running 32bit Windows you can build it yourself.

Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/vevix/FixWin81Taskbar/releases) and store it somewhere. The application will add itself to startup so you only need to run it once.
