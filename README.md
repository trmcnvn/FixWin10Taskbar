# FixWin81Taskbar

In Windows 8 when you had a fullscreen borderless application (game) open on your primary monitor you could click the extended taskbar on your secondary monitor and it would bring the primary monitors taskbar on top. This is no longer the case in Windows 8.1 and it has frustrated me to no end.

FixWin81Taskbar restores that functionality :+1:!

# Usage

I'll only supply x64 builds of this application, if you are running 32bit Windows you can build it yourself.

Download the latest release from the Releases page here on GitHub and store it somewhere. The application will add itself to startup so you only need to run it once.
